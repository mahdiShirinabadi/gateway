# SignedTokenData Removal Summary

## Overview
`SignedTokenData` and related services have been **completely removed** from the service1 project as they are no longer necessary with the new `TokenInfo` approach.

## Removed Components

### 1. **Deleted Classes**
- ❌ `SignedTokenData.java` - Legacy token data model
- ❌ `TokenCacheService.java` - Legacy token caching service  
- ❌ `SignatureVerificationService.java` - Legacy signature verification service

### 2. **Updated Classes**
- ✅ `CustomUserDetailsService.java` - Removed TokenCacheService dependency
- ✅ `TestController.java` - Removed SignatureVerificationService dependency

## Why SignedTokenData is No Longer Needed

### **Old Architecture (SignedTokenData)**
```
Token stored as field in object
Complex signature with timestamps
Self-contained approach
Legacy caching mechanism
```

### **New Architecture (TokenInfo)**
```
Token used as Redis key
Simple signature: username|permissions|token
Clean separation of concerns
Modern JSON-based storage
```

## Current Architecture

### **Service1 Responsibilities (Read-Only)**
1. **Read** token info from Redis using token as key
2. **Verify** signature using `username|permissions|token` format
3. **Check** expiration and delete expired tokens
4. **Never store** new tokens (Gateway handles storage)

### **Gateway Responsibilities (Write-Only)**
1. **Validate** JWT with SSO
2. **Get** user permissions from ACL
3. **Create** TokenInfo with signature
4. **Store** in Redis with TTL

## Benefits of Removal

✅ **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed 3 obsolete classes  
✅ **Better Performance**: No redundant token storage  
✅ **Simpler Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns  
✅ **Modern Approach**: JSON-based with proper serialization  
✅ **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer moving parts to maintain  

## Migration Impact

### **No Breaking Changes**
- All functionality preserved with `TokenInfo`
- Better performance and cleaner code
- Same security guarantees with simpler implementation

### **Files Updated**
- `CustomUserDetailsService.java` - Removed TokenCacheService dependency
- `TestController.java` - Removed SignatureVerificationService dependency
- All imports and references cleaned up

## Conclusion

**SignedTokenData is NOT necessary** in the service1 project anymore. The new `TokenInfo` approach provides:

- ✅ **Better Redis Design**: Token as key, data as value
- ✅ **Simpler Signature**: `username|permissions|token` format
- ✅ **Cleaner Code**: Fewer classes, better separation
- ✅ **Same Security**: All security guarantees maintained
- ✅ **Better Performance**: More efficient storage and retrieval

The service1 project is now **cleaner, simpler, and more maintainable** without the legacy SignedTokenData components.
